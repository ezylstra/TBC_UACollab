# Exploring Tucson Bird Count data

First stage of the project: cleaning up and merging two sets of Tucson Bird Count data.  
1. TBC data entered directly into Access database (currently managed by Tucson Audubon): [TucsonBirdCount-Access.csv](OriginalData/TucsonBirdCount-Access.csv)
2. TBD data entered into eBird: [TucsonBirdCount-eBird.csv](OriginalData/TucsonBirdCount-eBird.csv)

For more on the TBC, see the [Tucson Audubon website](https://tucsonaudubon.org/our-work/conserving-birds/citizen-science/tucson-bird-count/).

Briefly, there are more than 100 routes in the Tucson Valley. Most routes contain 8-12 survey locations (sites).
Most routes are surveyed one morning each spring. Observers conduct a 5-min stationary count at each site, recording the number of birds of each species observed.
